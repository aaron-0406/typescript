ENGINEERING PRACTICES:
----------------------

LAYERS OF ANALYSIS TO DELIVER CODE:

- Static analysis runs in your editor. Finds typos, incorrect function calls, autocompletes code.
- Unit tests take a few seconds to verify your code does what you think it does.
- Integration tests take a few minutes to validate your system works. May catch fun edge cases.
- Code review takes a few hours to validate you're following standard norms and practices of your team.
